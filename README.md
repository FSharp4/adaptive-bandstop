# Analysis of Adaptive FIR Filter Performance in Narrow Band Interference Suppression
> Jake Peterson & Ahmad Sawwas

This study presents an assessment of the performance of adaptive FIR filters in suppressing narrow band interferences corrupting signals with wideband desired contents. The effects of multiple parameters governing the overall system performance were considered. Adaptations were governed utilizing LMS and RLS algorithms where a comparison between both algorithmsâ€™ capabilities is presented. Simulations of both adaptation algorithms were conducted on MATLAB considering stationary and dynamic environments with different SNR levels. Results showed that, under appropriate tuning of the adaptive algorithm parameters and a suitable system delay, the FIR filter provides satisfactory results under all tested operating environments.
